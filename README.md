# Phishing Threat Report: Student Financial Aid Scam

This project simulates a phishing attack targeting university students. I analyzed red flags, explained the impact, and recommended countermeasures. It demonstrates my ability to detect threats and communicate findings — skills I’m sharpening as I study for CompTIA Security+ and prepare for a cybersecurity or intelligence role.

## 🧠 Why I Created This

As someone who naturally overthinks, I wanted to show how that mindset becomes a strength in cyber defense. This project taught me how cyberattacks often target human weakness, and how critical it is to spot small red flags others overlook.
